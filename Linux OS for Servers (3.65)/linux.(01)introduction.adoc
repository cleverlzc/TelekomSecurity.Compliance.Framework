== Linux OS for Servers
===	1. Introduction
Linux is a popular operating system for server systems. It is used from single
bare metal servers to high scaling cloud environments.

This documents includes examples for technical implementation and compliance
checks for the security requirements of https://security.telekom.com/[Telekom Security]
for Linux OS for servers  [Doc. 'SecReq 3.65: Linux OS for Servers'].

The examples in this document are tested for the following Linux distributions:

* Ubuntu LTS 14.04
* Ubuntu LTS 16.04
* Ubuntu LTS 18.04
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.x (RHEL)
* CentOS 7.x (CentOS)
* Oracle Linux 7.x (Oracle)
* Amazon Linux AMI (v2)
* Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SLES)

RHEL, CentOS, Oracle and Amazon Linux are summarized in the following documents as 'RedHat'.

NOTE: Root privileges are needed to perform compliance checks and to implement needed
configuration for the security requirements on a Linux system.

==== 1.1 Scope
In scope of this is document are server systems with Linux OS. This includes
the following types of servers:

* bare metal servers
* virtualized servers (VMs)
* virtualization hosts

==== 1.2 Not in Scope
This document is not intended to be used for workstations with Linux OS and
container images based on Linux. Because of different use cases, associated
threats and needed software, workstations need another set of requirements.
Container images have to be treated differently as they normally do not include
a full Linux OS.
