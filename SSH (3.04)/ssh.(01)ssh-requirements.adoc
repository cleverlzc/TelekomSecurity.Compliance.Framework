== Secure Shell (SSH)
=== 1.	Introduction

SSH (Secure Shell) is a client/server application inclusive a network protocol
that can be used to access systems on terminal level and to transfer data. As SSH
is typically used for management access, this service has a high security demand.
This document includes security requirements for SSH server, SFTP server and the
SSH protocol. It is recommended to use OpenSSH as this is a well-known solution
with a huge developer community.

This documents includes examples for technical implementation and compliance
checks for the security requirements of https://security.telekom.com/[Telekom Security]
for Secure Shell (SSH) [Doc. 'SecReq 3.04: SSH'].

The examples in this document are tested for the following SSH software:

* OpenSSH

NOTE: Root privileges are needed to perform compliance checks and to implement needed
configuration for the security requirements for SSH.

==== 1.1 Special Requirements

NOTE: SSH daemon must be restarted after the implementation of the configuration!

Use the following command to restart SSH daemon:
----
# service <ssh-daemon> restart
----
Values for <ssh-daemon>: +
Debian based Linux distributions: 'ssh' +
RedHat based Linux distributions: 'sshd' +

NOTE: Before configuring SSH the running version must be verified and validated
if current version is used! Check version on https://www.openssh.com/[openssh.com].

Use the following commands the check installed OpenSSH version:

Debian based Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) distributions:
----
   # dpkg -l | awk '/openssh-server/ {print $3}'
----

RedHat based Linux (e.g. CentOS, Amazon Linux) distributions:
----
   # rpm -qa | awk -F- '/openssh-server/ {print $3}'
----

Alternative command (all Linux versions):
----
   # ssh -v
----
Expected output: version of installed OpenSSH software

=== 2.	Security requirements

[#req365-1]
==== Req 1:	The SSH protocol version 2 must be used.

SSHv1 must permanently be disabled in configuration of the SSH server. With
OpenSSH 7.4 support for SSHv1 completely removed and must not longer be configured.

_Motivation:_ SSH protocol version 1 has weaknesses and is obsolete today. With
the use of SSHv1 the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data cannot be
guaranteed.

*Compliance Check* (only for OpenSSH prior 7.4)

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^Protocol" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: Protocol 2

*Implementation* (only for OpenSSH prior 7.4)

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   Protocol 2
----

[#req365-2]
==== Req 2:	SSH moduli smaller than 2048 must not be used.

The file "/etc/ssh/moduli" contains pre-generated group parameters â€“ named
moduli - for Diffie-Hellman. Here are also moduli available that are not long
enough to withstand known attacks. To avoid the use of short values moduli
smaller than 2048 must be deleted from file " /etc/ssh/moduli ".

_Motivation:_ If the DH moduli is to short the key exchange is not protected
in an adequate way.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to show all moduli not fulfilling the requirement:
----
   # awk '$5 < 2048' /etc/ssh/moduli
----
Expected output: if all moduli are correct nothing should be shown

*Implementation*

Use the following commands to delete wrong moduli from file '/etc/ssh/moduli':
----
   awk '$5 >= 2048' /etc/ssh/moduli > /etc/ssh/moduli.new ;
   [ -r /etc/ssh/moduli.new -a -s /etc/ssh/moduli.new ] && mv /etc/ssh/moduli.new /etc/ssh/moduli || true
----

[#req365-3]
==== Req 3:	Only approved key exchange algorithms must be used.

For key exchange the following algorithms are allowed:

*	curve25519-sha256 @libssh.org
*	diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
*	ecdh-sha2-nistp521
*	ecdh-sha2-nistp384
*	ecdh-sha2-nistp256

_Motivation:_ An attacker can possibly break the encryption of transported data
if weak ciphers and algorithms are used to access sensitive data.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^KexAlgorithms" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: KexAlgorithms <key-exchange-algorithms>
See requirement for allowed <key-exchange-algorithms>!

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   KexAlgorithms keyex-algo1,keyex-algo2,...,keyex-algoN>
----
See requirement for allowed key-exchange algorithms!

[#req365-4]
==== Req 4:	Only approved ciphers algorithms must be used.

Outdated and insecure ciphers and algorithms must not be used. Use the following
ciphers for SSH:

*	chacha20-poly1305 @openssh.com
*	aes256-gcm @openssh.com
*	aes128-gcm @openssh.com
*	aes256-ctr
*	aes192-ctr
*	aes128-ctr

_Motivation:_ An attacker can possibly break the encryption of transported data
if weak ciphers and algorithms are used to access sensitive data.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^Cipher" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: Ciphers <chiphers>
See requirement for allowed <chipers>!

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   Ciphers cipher1,cipher2,...,cipherN>
----
See requirement for allowed ciphers!

[#req365-5]
==== Req 5:	Only approved MAC algorithms must be used.

It is important to avoid the use of insecure MAC algorithms for SSH. Examples
of such outdated algorithms are MD5 and SHA1. The following MAC algorithms are
allowed and must be configured for SSH daemon:

*	hmac-sha2-512-etm\@openssh.com
*	hmac-sha2-256-etm\@openssh.com
*	hmac-sha2-512
*	hmac-sha2-256

_Motivation:_ An attacker can possibly break the encryption of transported data
if weak ciphers and algorithms are used to access sensitive data.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^MACs" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: MACs <macs>
See requirement for allowed <macs>!

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   MACs mac1,mac2,...,macN>
----
See requirement for allowed MACs!

[#req365-6]
==== Req 6:	SSH logging must be enabled.

Logging for SSH must be enabled. It is recommended to use level INFO to get
important information but not to get a lot of useless events. If needed higher
levels like VERBOSE can also be used.

_Motivation:_ Logging security-relevant events is a basic requirement for
detecting ongoing attacks as well as at-tacks that have already occurred. This
is the only way in which suitable measures can be taken to maintain or restore
system security. Logging data could be used as evidence to take legal steps
against attackers.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: LogLevel INFO
Beside INFO higher log levels like VERBOSE are also possible!

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   LogLevel INFO
----
Beside INFO higher log levels like VERBOSE are also possible!

[#req365-7]
==== Req 7:	SSH LoginGraceTime must be set to one minute or less.

The LoginGraceTime parameter restricts the time window for a successful
authentication. The longer this period is the more open unauthenticated
connections can be established. To avoid this a max time must be specified.
Recommended is 60 seconds.

_Motivation:_ An adequate time for LoginGraceTime parameter protects the system
against unauthenticated SSH connections which waste system resources.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^LoginGraceTime" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: LoginGraceTime 60

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   LoginGraceTime 60
----

[#req365-8]
==== Req 8:	SSH MaxAuthTries must be set to 5 or less.

The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
permitted per connection. This value must be limited to 5 or less attempts.

_Motivation:_ This parameter will minimize the risk of successful brute force
attacks to the SSH server.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^MaxAuthTries" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: MaxAuthTries 5

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
    MaxAuthTries 5
----

[#req365-9]
==== Req 9:	SSH root login must be disabled.

All users must have unique and personal user accounts. Constantly working as
root is not permitted. To avoid remote login with user root the login over SSH
must be disabled.

NOTE: It is also possible to achieve an adequate security level if only
functional user accounts are used on a system. It must be guaranteed to share
SSH keys over a central ac-count management system (e.g. ZAM) for the root user
and to enroll them with a configuration management system. Additionally, access
must be done over a jump server with personalized accounts. The use of SSH keys
for authentication is still mandatory (login with password over SSH is not
allowed).

_Motivation:_ It is a high risk to use user root on a Linux system and to allow
remote login. If an attacker is able to compromise this account, the system is
complete under control of the attacker.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: PermitRootLogin no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   PermitRootLogin no
----

[#req365-10]
==== Req 10:	SSH strict mode must be enabled.

SSH StrictModes must be enabled. This enables checks to ensure that SSH files
and directories have the proper permissions and ownerships of the login user
before allowing an SSH session to open.

_Motivation:_ This feature blocks unwanted access to files and directories.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^StrictModes" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: StrictModes yes

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   StrictModes yes
----

[#req365-11]
==== Req 11:	SSH user authentication must be done with public keys.

Authentication with public/private key must be used for SSH login.

NOTE: The private key of human beings must be protected with a passphrase.

_Motivation:_ Passwords are usually attackable via Phishing, Keylogger and Brute
Force attacks. An attacker who occupies a password can misuse the corresponding
user account.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^PubkeyAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: PubkeyAuthentication yes

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
----

NOTE: Before activating this feature at least one user account must
be present on the system that are allowed to login over SSH and with
a public key configured (see link:#annex[Annex] for help)!

[#req365-12]
==== Req 12:	SSH password authentication must be disabled.

The login must be done with public/key authentication. Login with password only
must be disabled for SSH.

_Motivation:_ Passwords are usually attackable via Phishing, Keylogger and Brute
Force attacks. Additionally, pass-words can be easily shared and a non-repudiation
therefore is reasonable hard.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^PasswordAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: PasswordAuthentication no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   PasswordAuthentication no
----

NOTE: Before activating this feature at least one user account must
be present on the system that are allowed to login over SSH and with
a public key configured (see link:#annex[Annex] for help)!

[#req365-13]
==== Req 13:	SSH IgnoreRhosts must be enabled.

_Motivation:_ If a trust relationship is configured with another system an
attacker has direct access to all other trusted systems in case of an intrusion.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^IgnoreRhosts" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: IgnoreRhosts yes

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   IgnoreRhosts yes
----

[#req365-14]
==== Req 14:	SSH HostbasedAuthentication must be disabled.

_Motivation:_ If a trust relationship is configured with another system an
attacker has direct access to all other trusted systems in case of an intrusion.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^HostbasedAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: HostbasedAuthentication no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   HostbasedAuthentication no
----

[#req365-15]
==== Req 15:	The usage of the SSH service must be restricted to dedicated groups or users.

For easier and more secure system administration it is necessary to use dedicated
users or groups (recommended) for SSH.

_Motivation:_ The usage of dedicated users or groups makes user management for SSH
more secure.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^AllowGroups" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   # grep "^AllowUsers" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   # grep "^DenyGroups" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   # grep "^DenyUsers" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: user and groups

NOTE: It is recommended to configure and use a dedicated group for SSH. All users
that are allowed to access the system via SSH are added to this group. This means
also that paramters 'AllowUser', 'DenyGroups' and 'DenyUser' are not used and must
be empty.

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   AllowGroups <ssh-group>
----

[#req365-16]
==== Req 16:	The SSH Idle Timeout Interval must be configured to an adequate time.

To specify the time how long inactive SSH session hold open the following two
parameters must be configured:

*	ClientAliveInterval: timeout interval in seconds (recommended 300) after session
is terminated if no data is received.
*	ClientAliveCountMax: number of client alive messages (recommendation 0) which
may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client.

Example: if the ClientAliveInterval is 20 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax
is 3, the client SSH session will be terminated after 60 seconds of idle time.

_Motivation:_ Open or unused sessions give the possibility to an unauthorized
user for session high-jacking. This session can then be used to get access to
the effected system and its data.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^ClientAliveInterval" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   # grep "^ClientAliveCountMax" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: +
* ClientAliveInterval 300
* ClientAliveCountMax 0

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   ClientAliveInterval 300
   ClientAliveCountMax 0
----

[#req365-17]
==== Req 17:	SSH tunnel devices must be disabled.

SSH can be used to tunnel services. For management service of Linux servers this
is typically not used and can be disabled.

_Motivation:_ SSH tunnel feature can be used by an attacker to tunnel traffic to
own destinations.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^PermitTunnel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: PermitTunnel no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   PermitTunnel no
----

[#req365-18]
==== Req 18:	SSH TCP port forwarding must be disabled.

TCP forwarding can be used to forward TCP connections through SSH. For management
service of Linux servers this is typically not used and can be disabled.

IMPORTANT: This requirement is not valid for Jump Servers!

_Motivation:_ If this feature is not used in a controlled manner, it could be a
security risk for servers.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^AllowTcpForwarding" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: AllowTcpForwarding no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   AllowTcpForwarding no
----

[#req365-19]
==== Req 19:	SSH agent forwarding must be disabled.

SSH agent forwarding can be used to forward authentication requests to other
systems over SSH. For management service of Linux servers this is typically not
used and can be disabled.

IMPORTANT: This requirement is not valid for Jump Servers!

_Motivation:_ The server-side deactivation blocks the creation of a server-side
agent forwarding socket, this socket consequently cannot be misused.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^AllowAgentForwarding" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: AllowAgentForwarding no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   AllowAgentForwarding no
----

[#req365-20]
==== Req 20:	SSH gateway ports must be disabled.

SSH Gateway ports specifies whether remote hosts can connect to ports forwarded
for the client. For management service of Linux servers this is typically not
used and can be disabled.

_Motivation:_ If this feature is not used in a controlled manner, it could be
a security risk for servers.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^GatewayPorts" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: GatewayPorts no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   GatewayPorts no
----

[#req365-21]
==== Req 21:	SSH X11 forwarding must be disabled.

X11 is not used on Linux servers. The forwarding of X11 over SSH must be
disabled.

_Motivation:_ If this feature is not used in a controlled manner, it could be
a security risk for servers.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^X11Forwarding" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: X11Forwarding no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   X11Forwarding no
----

[#req365-22]
==== Req 22:	SSH PermitUserEnvironment must be disabled.

The SSH PermitUserEnviroment parameter specifies if user defined environment
variables are processed by sshd. This variable must be set to "no" to disable
it.

_Motivation:_ Enabling the processing environment variable may enable users
to bypass SSH access restrictions.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^PermitUserEnvironment" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: PermitUserEnvironment no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   PermitUserEnvironment no
----

[#req365-23]
==== Req 23:	SSH PermitEmptyPasswords must be disabled.

With the 'PermitEmptyPasswords' parameter can be configured the SSH server
allows login to an account with an empty password. This must not be allowed.

_Motivation:_ If login without a password remotely over SSH is possible
unauthorized users can get access to the server.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^PermitEmptyPasswords" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: PermitEmptyPasswords no

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   PermitEmptyPasswords no
----

[#req365-24]
==== Req 24:		If SFTP is activated, internal server of OpenSSH must be used.

OpenSSH has its own SFTP daemon. If SFTP should be used this function must be
enabled and configured in a secure way.

_Motivation:_ It is necessary to use the OpenSSH SFTP daemon to align the
security configuration for all SSH based services and not to have different
security levels.

*Compliance Check*

Use the following command to check configuration for correct
setting:
----
   # grep "^Subsystem sftp" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
----
Expected output: Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

*Implementation*

Add the following parameter and value to configuration file
'/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':
----
   Subsystem sftp internal-sftp -l INFO
----
Parameter '-l' activates logging for SFTP.

It is recommended to use a chroot environment for SFTP. This can be impmented
by adding the following configuration at the end of the file '/etc/ssh/sshd_conf':

----
   Match Group <sftp-group>
      ForceCommand internal-sftp -l INFO
      ChrootDirectory /home/%u
      llowTcpForwarding no
      AllowAgentForwarding no
      PasswordAuthentication no
      PermitRootLogin no
      X11Forwarding no
----

It is necessary to generate a group (add group name instead of <sftp-group>) for
SFTP and to add the users that are allowed to use SFTP to this group.

==== How to generate a public/private SSH key

It is recommended RSA keys only. The alternative DSA (Digital Signature
Algorithm) is not longer recommended as the possible key length is restricted
to 1024 bit in DSA.

Use the following command to create keypair:
----
   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
----

**The private key (id_rsa.) file should never be given to somebody else. As the
name says: it is private and intended to used only by you!**

NOTE: It is important to set a passphrase during the key generation. Otherwise
anybody who gets hand on the private key can misuse it to access your SSH servers!

==== Add a user with public key authentication

1 Generate a user account
----
   # useradd -m <user-name>
----

2 Add user to SSH group
----
   # usermod -a -G <ssh-group> <user-name>
----

3 Copy public key to users home directory

The file public key (id_rsa.pub) must be copied in the following directory:
/home/<user-name>/.ssh/

From remote client via SSH:
----
   # ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <user>@<server-address>
----
